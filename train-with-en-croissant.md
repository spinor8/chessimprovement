# 🥐 Using En Croissant for Chess Training Training

## 1. Launch En Croissant
- Open the **En Croissant** application on your system.
- Make sure you’re on the **Play** tab (where you can start games against the engine).

## 2. Set Up the Opening Position
- Search for opening in Lichess, https://lichess.org/opening and copy the PGN.
- In En Croissant, go to the Files tab (not Play).
- Click Create → Repertoire.
- Open the new repertoire file.
- Enter moves copied earlier.

---

## 3. Configure the Engine
- Select the engine you want to play against (e.g., Stockfish).
- Choose **15 minutes per side** as the time control:
  - Navigate to **Game Settings → Time Control**.
  - Set **15:00** for both White and Black.
- Adjust difficulty if needed (engine strength slider or depth settings).

## 4. Play the Game
- Start the game from the Modern Benoni setup.
- Play your moves against the engine.
- The clock will run with the 15‑minute control.

---

## 5. Save the Game
- After the game ends, go to **File → Save Game**.
- Save in **PGN format** (Portable Game Notation).
  - Example filename: `Benoni_Training_2025-11-28.pgn`
- Store all PGNs in a dedicated folder (e.g., `~/Chess/BenoniTraining/`).

## 6. Future Analysis & Annotation
- Open saved PGNs in En Croissant or another database tool (ChessBase, SCID, ChessX).
- Use **annotation tools**:
  - Add comments to moves.
  - Insert variation trees.
  - Highlight critical positions.
- Keep a version‑controlled archive (GitHub or local Git) to ensure annotations are never lost.
